Documentation Boilerplate
=========================

## Introduction

A simple solution that uses markdown and Bootcamp to create a neutrally aesthetic, mobile-optimized and content-focused document.

## Instructions

- Edit `document.md` for your main content or create a new markdown file. Pass in the source of the markdown file by calling it in the query of the url: `/?src=[MARKDOWN FILENAME]`
- Edit `js/view.js` for meta information
- Edit `index.html` for the footer HTML
- Serve the folder from a web server (this is required since the `file:` protocol does not allow for AJAX requests which is used to load the markdown file)
