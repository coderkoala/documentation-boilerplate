_Highlighted Text_ with Title of Document
=========================================

## Introduction

This is the leading introduction for the documentation. It should not be longer than three to four sentances. This boilerplate is an easy way to create technical documentation using markdown. It utilizes the styles from Bootcamp.

This is the continuation of the documentation if there needs to be a more detailed explanation of the purpose of this document as well 

## Table Example

This is an example of a table. The first table will be visible on all devices because it has the class `all-devices`. The second table will be converted into an unordered list based on key-value parings using the information within the table. `<thead>` and `<tbody>` elements are required.

<table class="all-devices">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
            <th>Column 3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Value 1</td>
            <td>Value 2</td>
            <td>Value 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Value 1b</td>
            <td>Value 2b</td>
            <td>Value 3b</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Re-size the browser window to see the table respond to the limited width.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
            <th>Column 3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Value 1</td>
            <td>Value 2</td>
            <td>Value 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Value 1b</td>
            <td>Value 2b</td>
            <td>Value 3b</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
